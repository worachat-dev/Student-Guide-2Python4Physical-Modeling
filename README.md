**A Student's Guide to Python for Physical Modeling: Jupyter Notebook Edition**

This repository provides Jupyter Notebook versions of the code examples found in the book *A Student's Guide to Python for Physical Modeling: Second Edition* by Jesse M. Kinder and Philip Nelson ([https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Python-Physical-Modeling/dp/0691180563](https://www.amazon.com/Students-Guide-Python-Physical-Modeling/dp/0691180563)).

**Acknowledgments**

* The original code and explanations in this project are derived from the book *A Student's Guide to Python for Physical Modeling: Second Edition* by Jesse M. Kinder and Philip Nelson. We are grateful for their contribution to scientific computing education.  
* This project utilizes Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment for Python ([https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)). We acknowledge the Jupyter Project for creating this valuable tool.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone this repository:**  
   Bash  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/a-students-guide-to-python-for-physical-modeling.git`

   Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.  
2. **Install required libraries:**  
   The code examples in this repository rely on several Python libraries, including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. You can install them using pip:  
   Bash  
   `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`

3. **Open a Jupyter Notebook:**  
   Navigate to the project directory using your terminal and launch a Jupyter Notebook server:  
   Bash  
   `cd a-students-guide-to-python-for-physical-modeling`  
   `jupyter notebook`

   This will open a web interface where you can browse and execute the Jupyter notebooks.

**Exploring the Code**

Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to a code fragment from the book, with explanations and comments embedded within the code. Feel free to explore the notebooks, modify the code, and experiment\!


**Additional Notes**

* Some code examples may require additional data files that are not included in this repository. Please refer to the book for instructions on obtaining these data files.  
* The book provides a more comprehensive explanation of the concepts covered in the code examples. We highly recommend reading the book alongside this repository for a deeper understanding of the material.

We hope this repository provides a valuable resource for learning Python for physical modeling using Jupyter notebooks.
